# On The Side
Things that are just written on my free time that I can't quite make an individual repository for.

## Description of Programs

#### But Every
Literally find and replace, asks user for a file, what word(s) to find in that file, and what word(s)/file to replace it with. Output is a text file with the result, titled based on user inputs.

#### Don't Poop Your Pants
A simple text-based game based on the actual game "Don't \**** Your Pants," found on Kongregate and NewGrounds.

#### Uninstall QuickTime
Windows batch script that uninstalls Quicktime (and asks for UAC permissions if they weren't available when first running the file)

#### Restore Missing Windows Boot Partitions
Windows has *extremely* necessary boot partitions for UEFI based systems. If they get deleted, Windows would not be able to boot. This restores them if they're not there or are corrupted. This needs to run in the WindowsPE environment, as I assume it would be used when you can't boot into the Windows OS environment.

#### Scoring
Super simple program that just asks for inputs of names and corresponding scores, and outputs the highest, lowest, and average score of that thing. Nothing much really.
